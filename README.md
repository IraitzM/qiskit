## Building and installing the library

Creating a virtual environment is more than recommended:

```
python -m venv <venv_name>
```

Afterwards, one can just build the library:

```
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

And proceed to install it using the route of the library *dist/quanvia-x.x.x....whl* by a simple pip install routine. Enjoy!
